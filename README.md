# Omarchy on Arch — Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration for an Arch Linux–based **Omarchy** setup, with XDG-compliant configs under `.config/` for **Hyprland** (`.config/hypr`), **Waybar** (`.config/waybar`), and the **Starship** prompt (`.config/starship.toml`). It’s kept minimal, readable, and versioned so I can reproduce the same environment across machines.

To use it, clone into your home directory and **link or copy** the relevant folders/files into `~/.config` (e.g., with GNU Stow or your preferred symlink method). Review settings before applying—some options are opinionated and tuned for my workflow in Omarchy/Hyprland, but everything is easy to adapt.
